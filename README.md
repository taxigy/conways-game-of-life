# Conway's Game of Life, ES6 implementation
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life on ES6 (Node). It's
pretty useless repo, though.

## Todo

- [ ] Make code more readable and compliant to common sense (avoid `+!!x` stuff)
- [ ] Feed a file with initial grid as a parameter.
- [ ] Cool CLI view with colors and static positioning.
